<p id="tribute-info">Dan Kaminsky (February 7, 1979 – April 23, 2021) was a US information security researcher and hacker who was best known for discovering, in 2008, a vulnerability in the Internet's Domain Name System (DNS) that would have allowed "criminals and pranksters" (according to the New York Times) to send users to malicious websites on a massive scale across the Internet.</p>

<p>Kaminsky alerted Paul Vixie, the man who invented DNS, as well as the US Department of Homeland Security and officials at Cisco and Microsoft. They kept the problem secret until it could be fixed—the largest-ever synchronized fix to the Internet’s infrastructure. </p>

<p>Of the seven Recovery Key Shareholders who possess the ability to restore the DNS root keys, Kaminsky was the American representative. He also advised Fortune 500 companies such as Cisco, Avaya, and Microsoft. </p>

<p>Kaminsky was a frequent and influential speaker at large hacker conferences including BlackHat, HOPE, and the Chaos Communications Congress.</p>

<p>In a field with a reputation for oversized egos and misogyny, Kaminsky was known for his humility, kindness, and ability to work happily with many different kinds of people. He was widely mourned after his death from diabetes complications in the Spring of 2021.</p>

<p>Kaminsky learned to code by age five, on a Radio Shack computer that his father bought him. </p>
